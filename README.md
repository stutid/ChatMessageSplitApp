# ChatMessageSplitApp

Chat Message Split App lets you break a longer message into a number of smaller messages. 

The maximum character limit is 50 characters per message.

When we type a message which is longer than 50 characters but without a space, it gives an error.

When we type a message which is longer than 50 characters, it automatically breaks the message from the last occurrence of the space and appends a part indicator at the start of the messages.

As one enters a message, it will get displayed on the UI in the appropriate manner as per the above conditions.
